## Our Innovative Solution: Nile Red + Modified Foldscope

### Core Innovation
**Fluorescence-Based Chemical Detection using Paper Microscopy**
- Combine Nile Red fluorescent dye with modified Foldscope for chemical identification
- Transform particles into glowing fluorescent spots for easy visual detection
- Ultra-portable system requiring no electricity

---

## How It Works

### 1. Sample Preparation (5 minutes)
```
Water Sample → Add Nile Red Dye → Mix & Incubate → Filter onto Slide → Ready for Analysis
```
- **Nile Red staining**: Dye selectively binds to plastic surfaces
- **Incubation time**: 5-10 minutes for complete staining
- **Sample volume**: 50-100 mL per test

### 2. Detection Process
```
Blue LED Excitation → Fluorescent Plastic Particles → Visual Detection → Manual Counting
```
- **Excitation**: 470nm blue LED illuminates sample
- **Fluorescence**: Plastic particles glow bright orange/red
- **Detection**: Visual identification through modified Foldscope
- **Results**: Immediate particle count and size estimation

### 3. Modified Foldscope Setup
