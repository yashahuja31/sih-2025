Rhodamine B + Foldscope: Frugal Microplastics Detection Prototype
Problem Statement Summary

Challenge: Build a low-cost, portable, and efficient sensor for detecting microplastics in water sources that works in field conditions and gives real-time insights.

Current Gap: Conventional methods (FTIR, Raman spectroscopy) are:

Extremely expensive (₹10L+)

Laboratory-dependent

Slow and resource-intensive

Our Innovative Solution: Rhodamine B + Modified Foldscope
Core Innovation

Frugal Fluorescence Detection using Paper Microscopy

Replace expensive Nile Red with Rhodamine B (readily available under ₹1000)

Use UV LED excitation to induce fluorescence in plastics stained with Rhodamine B

Combine with Foldscope for visual microplastic detection in the field

👉 A truly frugal prototype that demonstrates feasibility now, while allowing a future upgrade to Nile Red + Blue LED for higher accuracy.

How It Works
1. Sample Preparation (5 minutes)
Water Sample → Add Rhodamine B Dye → Mix & Incubate → Filter onto Slide → Ready for Imaging


Rhodamine B staining: Binds to hydrophobic plastic surfaces (less specific than Nile Red, but usable)

Incubation time: 5–10 minutes

Sample volume: 50–100 mL per test

2. Detection Process
UV LED Excitation → Fluorescent Plastic Particles → Visual Detection → Manual Counting


Excitation: ~365 nm UV LED

Fluorescence: Plastics glow reddish-pink

Detection: Visual identification through modified Foldscope

Results: Particle count + size estimation
