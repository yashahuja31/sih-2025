# Rhodamine B & UV Light/ Nile Red & Blue LED + Foldscope: Low-Cost Microplastics Detection Sensor

## 🚩 Problem Statement

**Microplastics** (<5 mm) are now found in oceans, rivers, and even drinking water.
They threaten ecosystems, aquatic life, and human health.

Current gold-standard techniques like **FTIR and Raman spectroscopy** are:

* ❌ Too expensive (₹10L+ setups)
* ❌ Lab-only (not portable)
* ❌ Time-consuming (hours to days per test)

**Challenge**: Build a **low-cost, portable, field-ready sensor** that can detect microplastics in real time.

## 💡 Our Innovative Solution

We combine:

* **Fluorescence Detection** → using **Rhodamine B dye + UV light** to make plastics glow.
* **Optical Imaging** → using a **Foldscope + Camera + Raspberry Pi** to capture images.
* **Machine Learning** → to automatically classify whether water contains microplastics.

🌟 **Future Upgrade**: Switch to **Nile Red + Blue LED + Filters** for 90–98% accuracy.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1. Sample Prep (\~5 min)

```
Water Sample → Add Rhodamine B → Incubate → Filter onto slide
```

### 2. Detection Process

```
UV LED Excitation → Plastics Glow Pink/Red → Foldscope + Camera → Image Captured
```

### 3. Processing

```
Raspberry Pi → Capture Image → ML Model → Result
```

* If plastics are found → tagged as contaminated
* If no plastics → tagged as clean
