official repo for the sih 2025 problem statement of one of these four problem statements


1. Real-Time Public Transport Tracking for Small Cities (25013)
description :
In small cities and tier-2 towns, public transport systems lack real-time tracking, causing inconvenience to commuters who face unpredictable bus schedules. This leads to overcrowding, wasted time, and reduced reliance on public transport. The problem is acute in cities with growing populations but limited digital infrastructure for transport management.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Over 60% of commuters in small cities face delays due to lack of real-time information, reducing public transport usage and increasing private vehicle dependency, which worsens traffic and pollution. A solution would enhance commuter experience and promote sustainable transport.

Expected Outcomes

• A mobile app or web platform integrating GPS-based real-time tracking of buses.
• Display estimated arrival times and route information.
• Optimized for low-bandwidth environments to ensure accessibility in smaller towns.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Commuters
• Local transport authorities
• Municipal corporations

Supporting Data

• Urban Mobility India Report 2024, emphasizing transport inefficiencies in tier-2 cities.

2. Disaster Response Drone for Remote Areas (25047)
description:
Background

Develop a drone-based system to deliver medical supplies and communication devices to remote areas during natural disasters (floods, earthquakes). The drone should use AI for real-time navigation and obstacle avoidance, with a payload capacity of at least 5 kg.

Expected Outcome

A working drone prototype with a mobile app for disaster management teams to coordinate deliveries, reducing response time by 20% in inaccessible regions.

Technical Feasibility

Employs existing drone hardware with open-source flight control software (e.g., Ardupilot) and AI algorithms for navigation, tested in simulated disaster scenarios.

3. Al-Based Rockfall Prediction and Alert System for Open-Pit Mines (25071)
description:
Rockfalls in open-pit mines pose a significant threat to both personnel and equipment, often resulting in serious injuries, operational delays, and financial loss. Traditional rockfall detection systems rely on visual inspection or expensive proprietary solutions, which are either labor-intensive or lack real-time predictive capabilities. With the increasing use of digital monitoring and AI, there is a pressing need to integrate predictive analytics into slope stability assessments for proactive decision-making.

Description

This problem invites participants to design a smart, AI-based system capable of predicting potential rockfall incidents in open-pit mines. The system should process multi-source data inputs including:
- Digital Elevation Models (DEM)
- Drone-captured imagery
- Geotechnical sensor data (displacement, strain, pore pressure)
- Environmental factors (rainfall, temperature, vibrations)

Machine learning models should identify patterns that precede rockfall events. The system must feature a user-friendly dashboard for mine planners, along with:
- Real-time risk maps
- Probability-based forecasts
- Alert mechanisms (via SMS/email)
Integration with low-cost monitoring hardware would be an added advantage.

Expected Solution

- A machine learning model trained on real or synthetic data to predict rockfall risks.
- A web/mobile-based dashboard for visualization of vulnerable zones.
- Real-time alert generation with suggested action plans.
- Open-source integration possibilities for scale and customization.

Impact

The solution should be cost-effective, scalable for different mine sites, and adaptable for both public and private mining operations, enabling safer and more resilient mining practices.

4. Development of Sensor for Detection Of Microplastics (25036)
description:
Background

Microplastics — plastic particles less than 5 mm in size — have emerged as a global environmental threat, contaminating oceans, freshwater systems, and even drinking water. These particles originate from the degradation of larger plastics or from microbeads in consumer products. Their persistence and bioaccumulative nature pose serious risks to aquatic life, ecosystems, and potentially human health. Current methods for detecting microplastics — such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy — are often accurate but time-consuming, expensive, and laboratory-dependent, limiting their application for real-time, field-based monitoring.

Description

The project aims to develop a low-cost, efficient, and portable sensor capable of detecting microplastics in various water sources. The focus may be on using optical detection techniques — such as light scattering, fluorescence, or absorbance — combined with machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition. The sensor may be designed to identify microplastic particles based on their optical signatures, size distribution, and possibly polymer type. Water samples shall pass through a detection chamber, where embedded sensors capture spectral or visual data. This information would be processed in real time, either on-device or via a connected application. The system should be tested using standard microplastic samples (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene) and validated against existing lab-based techniques.

Expected Solution

The expected outcome is a compact, field-deployable sensor system that can detect and quantify microplastics in water samples within minutes. It should offer reasonable sensitivity (down to 10–100 μm), operate on battery or solar power, and require minimal sample preparation. Additionally, the solution may include a companion software interface for data logging, visualization, and analysis. This innovation should have strong potential for adoption in microplastic monitoring, supporting researchers, environmental agencies, and water quality managers in making faster, data-driven decisions for pollution control and mitigation.
